# Firecracker
This plugin adds brick items to the player inventory, which behave like firecrackers when thrown!

They will show flame particles and emit a fizzing sound, and after 3 seconds they will explode!

They will not hurt entities, and not damage the environment (Unlike real ones!)

## Config
There are 2 config options:
- give-items-after: How many seconds should pass until the player receives a new firecracker
- translation: How the firecrackers should be named. Color codes like `Â§c` are supported

## Download
Head to Poggit to grab a pre-built `.phar`

## Information
This was one of the first plugins i ever wrote. Now, some years later (Silvester 2019/20) i stumbled upon it and thought: _"Hey, it is silvester, this plugin was quite fun, why not update it?_, so i recoded it.

Be safe! **And remember: Firecrackers are no toys. Real firecrackers can harm you and other people! Use them carefully!**
